# daqparse - interpret CSV data from DAQ

DAQ data is expected to be in regular CSV form, with a first line providing
column leaders.

The tools for interpreting the data are expected to run on a laptop or
desktop machine, not the pod computers.  Scripts are envisioned in a
combination of Python and NumPy-based visualization such as Bokeh.
